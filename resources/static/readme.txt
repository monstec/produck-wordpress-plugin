# Recommendations #
We recommend to submit at least two chats per week, to keep your page interesting for search engines. Adjust the wording of your customers’ question in the “quackify” section after the chat was accomplished, to find a very catchy headline which will be indexed on google later on. Try to provide crisp, but also holistic answers to customer queries. Additional answers can help, to keep a specific question relevant to future visitors with similar issues. Holistic answers are more likely to support a good ranking on search engines. From our experience, your site ranking will benefit noticeably after 20 published chats. All the best. Your ProDucks.

== Installation ==
Install the  ProDuck Wordpress plugin in just a few steps:

* Register on https://www.produck.de/signup.html “Als Experte” (as expert).
* After you have set up your account on https://www.produck.de, login into your account and choose “Profil” on the left-side menu. In your profile, you will find your customer ID in the box “Kunden-ID”, which will be needed to connect your chat and the quacks to your account.
* Now install the plugin and activate the plugin in your Wordpress installation.
* Then open the configuration of your ProDuck Plugin which can be found via the settings menu item in the Wordpress administration. You will be immediately prompted for your customer ID and whether you want to show a Produck.de link beneath your Quack-pages.
* Change the other settings or keep it if suitable to your preferences. All settings are explained directly on the administration page.
* The most important setting is the quack token. This is mandatory if you want to show quacks on your website. You get your token in the settings of your account on https://www.produck.de.
* Finally, the Produck plugin uses virtual posts/pages, thus the necessary routing does only work if the permalinks setting of Wordpress is set to something other than the first option ("Plain"). Alternatively, you could for example choose "Day and Name".

Now you are ready to go. After you have created the first quacks, they should appear on your website automatically. If not, contact us on https://www.produck.de?cid=53.
